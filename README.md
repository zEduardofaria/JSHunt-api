# JSHunt-api

Project to train Node concepts in practice, and serve two apps of mine, [JSHunt-mobile](https://github.com/zEduardofaria/JSHunt-mobile) and [JSHunt-web](https://github.com/zEduardofaria/JSHunt-web).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. This project didn't have the purpose of be pretty. I just tested some React's old versions in practice.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

* [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/)

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zEduardofaria/JSHunt-api.git
cd JSHunt-web
npm install
npm start
```
